# adv_calc_1

In this project I will try to create an interactive command line application. In this application user is prompted to write assignment operations or mathematical expressions. Then this is evaluated and the result is printed on to the command line. The lines executed before are not forgotten. The previously assigned variables can be used in succeeding lines.
